    # Introduction

    Telstra's Event Detection API provides the ability to subscribe to and receive mobile network events for registered mobile numbers associated with Telstra's mobile network, such as; SIM swap, port-in, port-out, new MSIDN, new mobile service and cancelled mobile service, as well as carrier-detection.

    ## Features

    Event Detection API provides these features
      | Feature              | Description |
      |---|---|
      |`SIM swap` | Returns timestamped event data when any of the following network events occurs in connection with a registered mobile number associated with Telstra’s mobile network:  SIM swap, port-in, port-out, new MSISDN, new mobile service or cancelled mobile service |
      |`Carrier Detection` | Find out what Australian carrier a mobile number is subscribed to |
      |`International Roaming` | *Coming soon.* Will indicate if a mobile number is operaing in Australia or outside of Australia. |

    ## Getting access to the API

    The Event Detection API is available on our Enterprise Plans only.

    ## Frequently asked questions

    **Q: What is the Telstra Event Detection (TED) API?**

    A: The Telstra Event Detection (TED) API is a subscription based service from Telstra that enables a customer to be alerted when a particular network event is detected in connection with a registered mobile number that may indicate that a fraudulent misuse of an end user’s mobility service is about to occur.


    **Q: What are the network events that the TED API can detect?**

    A: Currently the TED API is able to detect a bundle of events associated with Telstra SIM swaps.


    **Q: Can TED API detect number porting between operators other than Telstra? E.g. Optus to Vodafone?**

    A: No, we don’t report these type of events at present.


    **Q: How quickly are the network events detected?**

    A: This will vary depending on the event being detected, but generally we detect the event within a couple of seconds of it occurring and notify subscribers within near real time via the API.


    **Q: How long does Telstra store the event data for?**

    A: Event data is stored for 90 days from the occurrence of a network event and then securely purged.


    **Q: Is there a limit to the number of registered mobile numbers I can have for the Telstra Event Detection API?**

    A: No. You may have as many Telstra Event Detection API registered mobile numbers as you require within practical limits.


    **Q: Why is monitoring for SIM SWAP events important?**

    A: Criminals are becoming much more savvy and will often try to circumvent two factor authentication protocols by swapping the SIM card for a particular mobile number in order to gain fraudulent access to the end user’s service. Monitoring for SIM swap events may provide early detection that this is occurring and help prevent criminals from being successful in their endeavours.


    **Q: If an end user is currently a customer of a Telstra Reseller that still utilises the Telstra Network, am I able to detect their Network events?**

    A: No. Telstra resellers such as Aldi Mobile are Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNO) that operate as totally independent businesses to Telstra. The Telstra SIM swap API does not monitor MNVO network events at present.


    **Q: How do I purchase Telstra Event Detection API?**

    A: At the moment, the Telstra Event Detection API is only available through your Telstra Account Manager. If you don't have a Telstra Account Manager, or are not sure who they are, please submit a [sales enquiry](https://dev.telstra.com/content/sales-enquiry-contact-form).


    **Q: What support options are available for the Telstra Event Detection API?**

    A: We provide 24/7 telephone based technical support (for paid plans) along with email support and an online community forum.


    **Q: Do you detect network events from another carrier?**

    A: The Telstra Event Detection API detects network events associated with the Telstra network and Telstra mobile services.


    **Q: Which Telstra personnel have access to the event detection data?**

    A: Access to Telstra Event Detection data is restricted to only Telstra personnel that require access for the purposes of providing the service.


    **Q: Why should I purchase the Telstra Event Detection API from Telstra?**

    A: As the network events are occurring on the Telstra network, Telstra is in a position to be able to provide fast notification of an event as it is occurring, helping subscribers to prevent fraudulent activity from occurring and to minimise the resulting financial losses.


    **Q: If I require assistance setting up my Telstra Event Detection API, are there any Professional Services options available to me?**

    A: At the current time, the Telstra Event Detection API does not have any Professional Service options available.


    **Q: What subscription options are available for Telstra Event Detection API?**

    A: There is a month-by-month Pay As You Go (PAYG) plan or 12 Month contract option available.


    **Q: Do Early Termination Charges (ETC’s) apply?**

    A: If you have subscribed to a 12 month contract and want to terminate the plan or downgrade to a lower plan before the expiry of your existing 12 month term, we may charge you ETCs.


    **Q: What privacy requirements apply to my use of the Telstra Event Detection API?**

    A: Before registering an end user’s mobile number with Telstra Event Detection API, you must:

    1.  prepare an “End User Notification” for our approval, which sets out what end user information will be disclosed via the API, the purposes for which that information will be disclosed, and to which third parties that information will be disclosed;

    2.  provide each of your end user with the End User Notification; and

    3.  obtain express, informed consent from each end user to the use and disclosure of their event data via the API for the purposes set out in the notification.


    **Q: What terms and conditions apply to my use of the Telstra Event Detection API?**

    A: Before using the Telstra Event Detection API, you must agree to the TED API [“Our Customer Terms”](https://www.telstra.com.au/customer-terms/business-government#cloud-services).

          "expires_in" : "3599"
      }`

    ## Subscribe mobile numbers

    Subscribing end user mobile numbers informs the API to register that mobile number so that you can poll those numbers for particular events. You can subscribe and unsubscribe numbers (opt in and opt out) against this service. Only numbers that are opted in (i.e. subscribed) can be polled for events. You must have obtained your end customer’s consent before you can opt them into the Event Detection service.

    ## SIMswap sub-features

    The following is a list of the sub-features for SIM swap and the description for that sub-feature. These will appear in the 'eventId' parameter in the API response payload for SIMswap events.

    | SIM swap Sub-Feature              | Description |
      |---|---|
      |`NEW_MSISDN` | The MSISDN of a service changes. The SIM card is not changed. Results in two events being created: 1)  CREATE_SVC/PORT_IN_SVC for the new number, and 2)  a NEW_MSISDN for the old MSISDN |
      |`PORTIN_SVC` | A MSISDN registered for event detection is created as a mobile service on the Telstra network (note: if the MSISDN was not already registered by at least one customer for at least one event type, this event would be interpreted as a CREATE_SVC) |
      |`PORTOUT_SVC` | The MSISDN is ported out from Telstra to another domestic operator |
      |`NEW_SIM` | An existing Telstra MSISDN is moved onto a new SIM |
      |`CREATE_SVC` | A new mobile service is created on the Telstra network (a new SIM and a new MSISDN) |
      |`DELETE_SVC` | A mobile service (MSISDN and SIM) on the Telstra network is cancelled outright (as opposed to ported out to another domestic network) |
